https://teep93.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/ <- LIVE DEMO

Main takeaways from this project:</br>
-The game was initially only played in the console so going back and adding a GUI helped me better understand some fundamental and basic refactoring</br>
-Gave me a better understanding of functions, different ways of calling them and a practical use for parameters and arguments</br>
-Basic knowledge and application of DOM manipulation</br>
-A much better understanding of how to think more computational with my coding approach as this was a huge blocker for me initially </br>
