Main takeaways from this project:
-The game was initially only played in the console so going back and adding a GUI helped me better understand some fundamental and basic refactoring
-Gave me a better understanding of functions, different ways of calling them and a practical use for parameters and arguments
-Basic knowledge and application of DOM manipulation
-A much better understanding of how to think more computational with my coding approach as this was a huge blocker for me initially
